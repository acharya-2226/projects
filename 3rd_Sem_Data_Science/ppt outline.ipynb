    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Customer reviews play a crucial role in shaping purchasing decisions in e-commerce. Analyzing these reviews can provide valuable insights into customer sentiment, product performance, and areas for improvement. This project focuses on sentiment analysis of women's clothing e-commerce reviews to extract meaningful patterns and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objective**\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyze customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to:\n",
    "- **Perform sentiment classification** (positive, neutral, negative).\n",
    "- **Identify key themes and topics** discussed in reviews.\n",
    "- **Detect trends in customer feedback** over time.\n",
    "- **Provide data-driven insights** to improve product offerings and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Motivation and Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Motivation**\n",
    "Customer reviews are a vital source of information for both businesses and consumers. Understanding customer sentiment helps businesses:\n",
    "- Improve product quality and customer satisfaction.\n",
    "- Enhance marketing strategies based on customer feedback.\n",
    "- Identify key pain points and areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of e-commerce, analyzing vast amounts of textual data manually is inefficient. Automating this process through **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** allows businesses to extract valuable insights efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Background**\n",
    "E-commerce platforms generate large volumes of customer reviews daily. Traditional methods of analyzing feedback, such as surveys and focus groups, are time-consuming and limited in scope. Advances in **text mining**, **sentiment analysis**, and **topic modeling** enable more efficient and scalable ways to process and interpret customer feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on applying **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), NLP techniques, and machine learning models** to analyze womenâ€™s clothing reviews and derive actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
