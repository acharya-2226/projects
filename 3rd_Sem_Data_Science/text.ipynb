    "# Title Slide\n",
    "## Project Title: Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews Analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction and Objective\n",
    "## Brief Overview\n",
    "Analyzing customer reviews from an e-commerce clothing store to understand customer sentiment and product satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews.\n",
    "- Identify key factors influencing positive and negative feedback.\n",
    "- Build a predictive model to classify sentiment based on review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation and Background\n",
    "## Why is this problem important?\n",
    "- Customer feedback directly impacts business strategies.\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis helps brands improve customer experience.\n",
    "- Automated sentiment classification can aid product improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "- E-commerce platforms rely heavily on customer feedback for sales.\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Description\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "- Dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type of Data\n",
    "- Structured data: Contains numerical and textual attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features Used\n",
    "- `Review Text`: Main text data for sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- `Rating`: Used to classify sentiment.\n",
    "- `Age`: Analyzed to check correlation with sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methodology\n",
    "## Data Wrangling and ETL Processes\n",
    "- Loaded dataset and handled missing values.\n",
    "- Dropped unnecessary columns and performed data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Extraction and Selection Techniques\n",
    "- Text preprocessing: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization.\n",
    "- Feature representation: TF-IDF vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms/Models Used\n",
    "- Logistic Regression for sentiment classification.\n",
    "- Evaluation of alternative models (SVM, Random Forest).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "## Key Insights from EDA\n",
    "- Distribution of sentiments across different age groups.\n",
    "- Common words in positive vs. negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualizations\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sentiment Distribution\n",
    "sns.countplot(x=df['Sentiment'])\n",
    "plt.title(\"Sentiment Distribution\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results and Evaluation\n",
    "## Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))\n",
    "print(\"Classification Report:\\n\", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))\n",
    "print(\"Confusion Matrix:\\n\", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Comparisons\n",
    "- Logistic Regression vs. SVM vs. Random Forest.\n",
    "- Analyzed precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion and Future Work\n",
    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "- Successfully classified sentiments with high accuracy.\n",
    "- Identified key influencing words and factors in reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- Dataset imbalance may impact classification.\n",
    "- Sentiment classification limited by predefined ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Improvements\n",
    "- Implement deep learning models (LSTM, BERT) for better accuracy.\n",
    "- Explore multi-class classification beyond three sentiment classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q&A\n",
    "- Open for questions and feedback from the audience.\n"
